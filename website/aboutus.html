                    <br>
                    <p>Born in Jharkhand, <b>Vikram Kumar</b> is mostly a self taught artist. <b>Art</b> is a rejuvenating elixir which also helps us showcase our poetic temperament – this is beautifully reflected in his paintings. In the journey of his life – from Jharkhand to Delhi, Vikram has come a long way and his works of art are as much philosophy as art. He believes that emotions which otherwise may not find a suitable form of expression can be beautifully portrayed through intricate works of one’s imagination.</p>
                    <p>He is a Contemporary artist who also works as a Cartoonist and Social Worker. He is a founder member of Care Village Foundation and his artistic endeavours are more towards social causes – delving deep into the social psyche. In the lap of nature one can best look into his soul and his love for nature often does lead him to paint it on canvases as works of art.</p>
